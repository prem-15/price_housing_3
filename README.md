# AUSTRALIA HOUSE PRICE PREDCTING


Problem Statement - Part I
This assignment contains two parts. Part-1 is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter notebook) whereas part-2 includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file).

Assignment Part-I
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual value and flip them at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from house sales in Australia. The data is provided in the csv file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.

You are required to build a regression model using regularization, so as to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house

How well those variables describe the price of a house

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

Business Goal
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. It will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high rewards. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Problem Statement - Part II
The following questions are the second part of the graded assignment. Please submit the answers in one PDF file. For writing normal text, please use MS Word (or similar software which can convert documents to PDF). For writing equations and drawing figures, you can write/draw them on a blank sheet of paper using a pen, click images and upload them in the same word document.



## Conclusions

For lasso regression I have decided to keep very small value that is 0.01, when we increase the value of 
alpha the model try to penalize more and try to make most of the coefficient value zero. Initially it came 
as 0.4 in negative mean absolute error and alpha.
